All of this we will learn more indepth during the course of the program. \n","\n","For now lets see how we can drop missing values from a dataset."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"HvKBpbSVZq3X","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1621359931513,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":3507,"user":{"displayName":"Raymond Kiplangat","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgCuhWKtkM8UYW-JVZw3DvsRDJpjk2DwMOHGMgA=s64","userId":"01120465740264942012"}}},"source":["# Let's find out the size of our dataset\n","# \n","df.shape"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"TzPYCUtddJJn","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1621359931514,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":3498,"user":{"displayName":"Raymond Kiplangat","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgCuhWKtkM8UYW-JVZw3DvsRDJpjk2DwMOHGMgA=s64","userId":"01120465740264942012"}}},"source":["# If we were to keep our complete rows; meaning we drop any record with a missing value, then\n","#\n","df_dropped = df.dropna()\n","\n","# We are left with no rows of data\n","#\n","df_dropped.shape"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"AOZ80EPSdzGI","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1621359931515,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":3481,"user":{"displayName":"Raymond Kiplangat","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgCuhWKtkM8UYW-JVZw3DvsRDJpjk2DwMOHGMgA=s64","userId":"01120465740264942012"}}},"source":["# Printing out df_dropped\n","df_dropped"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"zAazAAGHgFkP","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1621359931516,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":3471,"user":{"displayName":"Raymond Kiplangat","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgCuhWKtkM8UYW-JVZw3DvsRDJpjk2DwMOHGMgA=s64","userId":"01120465740264942012"}}},"source":["# Challenge 14: Financial Allocation Dataset\n","# Let's now drop the records that have missing values\n","url = 'http://bit.ly/MSFinancialDataset'\n","#\n","df1=pd.read_csv(url)\n","df1.head(10)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"9iN2rc3m2FLq","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1621359931518,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":3455,"user":{"displayName":"Raymond Kiplangat","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgCuhWKtkM8UYW-JVZw3DvsRDJpjk2DwMOHGMgA=s64","userId":"01120465740264942012"}}},"source":["df1.shape"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"y80Acoy52NsA","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1621359931519,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":3452,"user":{"displayName":"Raymond Kiplangat","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgCuhWKtkM8UYW-JVZw3DvsRDJpjk2DwMOHGMgA=s64","userId":"01120465740264942012"}}},"source":["df1_dropped = df1.dropna()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"rQeIQHRa2XRA","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1621359931520,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":3442,"user":{"displayName":"Raymond Kiplangat","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgCuhWKtkM8UYW-JVZw3DvsRDJpjk2DwMOHGMgA=s64","userId":"01120465740264942012"}}},"source":["df1_dropped.shape"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"h5AGA9relVMf"},"source":["Challenge 15: Together with your peer discuss the cases where you might use the above drop/delete technique."]}]}
